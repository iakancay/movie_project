# Movie_project
  In this project I used `bootsrap` for `Css` and you can see some `DOM Manipilation` and `OOP`. 
You can add a new movie with three input Movie Title, Director, Poster. After clicking add buton you can see movie as a list under the form and at the same time movie recording in local storage. From movie list you can delete a movie or you can delete all movies.
